How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

-In designing software, I start by understanding the requirements and objectives. I then break down the project into smaller, manageable components. I focus on creating a modular design that allows for easy maintenance and scalability. I prioritize user experience and ensure the software is intuitive and efficient.For my final OpenGL project, I created a 3D scene featuring a stylized monument on a tiled platform, enhanced by realistic textures and lighting. My approach to designing software involves a structured process of planning, researching, prototyping, and iterating. This project helped me refine skills in texturing, lighting, and scene composition. I followed an iterative design process, where I continuously tested and improved the scene based on feedback and observations.

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

-Tactics from this design approach, such as iterative testing and prototyping, can be applied to future projects to ensure high-quality outcomes. Developing the 3D scene involved employing new strategies like UV mapping for textures and experimenting with lighting techniques to enhance realism. Iteration was crucial as I regularly refined the textures and lighting based on the visual outcomes. Throughout the project milestones, my coding approach evolved to become more structured and efficient, focusing on modular design and code reusability.
